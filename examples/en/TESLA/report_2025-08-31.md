## Summary

This report provides a Neutral/Cautious Hold rating for Tesla (TSLA). Based on the long-term growth potential of the global new energy vehicle market, Tesla’s self-sufficient production capacity, competitive advantages in charging networks and software ecosystem, the company holds long-term value potential. However, in the short term, uncertainties remain, such as intensifying industry competition, supply chain volatility, raw material costs, and dependency on the Chinese market. The current strategy favors an observational hold, considering increased allocation only when price and fundamentals fluctuate within a reasonable range.

## Research Thesis

- Long-term Positives (Bull Case): Ongoing global clean energy policies, Tesla’s robust moat built through in-house capacity, charging network, software, and energy management, with expectations for further improvements in gross margin and operational efficiency, thereby enhancing long-term profitability and shareholder value.
- Risks (Bear Case): Intensified industry competition, raw material cost volatility, reliance on the Chinese market, regulatory and compliance risks, uncertainties in autonomous driving and software monetization models, as well as capital expenditure demands potentially compressing profits.

## Portfolio Proposal

- Target Weight: 6% (0.06)
- Construction Plan (phased entry by date):
  - 2025-09-01: 0.1857% (approx. 0.19%)
  - 2025-09-02: 0.1929% (approx. 0.19%)
  - 2025-09-03: 0.20% (0.20%)

    Note: The sum of daily entries above totals about 1.00%, with a 5-day construction window. The cumulative entry is achieved through daily participation, with a maximum cumulative participation cap of 4x average daily volume (adv_multiple = 4.0), and the position is incrementally increased to the target weight within 5 days.
- Liquidity and Execution Rules
  - adv_multiple (daily participation as a multiple of ADV): 4.0
  - days_to_build (number of days to complete position building): 5.0
- Constraints (expressed as percentages, with rationale):
  - max_single_name: 6% — Rationale: Limit exposure to any single stock, reduce concentration risk.
  - sector_cap: 20% — Rationale: Limit total sector exposure, control sector concentration risk.
- Current vs. Target Exposure Difference
  - Current holding is approx. 5%, target is 6%. The plan is to gradually increase exposure within the construction window to reach the 6% target weight.

  - Current price and time: Latest price 333.86, time 2025-08-30 00:01:00Z
  - Daily change: -3.5%
  - 30-day ADV: N/A
  - 90-day ADV: N/A
  - Forecast: N/A

## Risk & Compliance

- VaR Setting: VaR(95%, 1-day, portfolio-level, scaled by target weight)
- Current VaR (based on input data): approx. 1.91% (riskCheck.var_95 = 0.0191)
- Risk threshold: 3.5% (VaR threshold)

- breach: false
- Compliance status: restricted: false; notes: auto-pass
- VaR Chart: please see risk image link below

  - VaR Curve Image: figs/var_curve.png

- Remarks
  - Risk detection shows that under the given weight and market input conditions, the current risk level is controllable, but ongoing monitoring of volatility and market sentiment impacts on high-valuation growth stocks is needed.

## Trading Plan

- Strategy Algorithm: VWAP
- Execution Benchmark: VWAP-based benchmark, aiming to trade as close as possible to the VWAP price during the trading period, reducing market impact and controlling costs relative to the benchmark
- Estimated Cost: approximately 18 basis points (bps)

## Advice Details

- Current Advice: HOLD
- Target Price: 350.00
- Position Size: currently approx. 5.0% (existing_position_size = 0.05)
- Active Weight (active_weight = position_size - target_weight): -0.01 (-1.0 percentage points), indicating the current position is below the target weight, requiring incremental buys during the build window to approach target
- Holding Period (horizon_days): 30 days (evaluation/holding period, not build window)
- Stop-Loss / Take-Profit: Multiples relative to entry price
  - stop_loss = 0.9 means a -10% drop triggers stop loss
  - take_profit = 1.2 means a +20% rise triggers take profit
- Construction Plan Notes
  - As the current position is below the target weight, the plan is to increase exposure in phases during the build window to reach the target, with the specific schedule as above
- Key Risks: Market volatility, intensified competition, macroeconomic uncertainty
- Catalysts: New model launches, technological innovation, market expansion

- Market Context
  - Sentiment label: Negative
  - Sentiment score: -0.2
  - Window: 7 days
  - Headline highlights: e.g., the impact of Tesla sales and demand signals on sentiment, AI-related news, etc.
